# Blackbox Swarm Prime

An advanced multi-agent system for automated revenue generation through DeFi protocols, flash loans, MEV opportunities, and yield farming. Features Stripe integration for virtual card issuance and automated profit distribution.

## Revenue Generation Methods

### 1. Flash Loan Arbitrage
- Automated detection of price discrepancies across DEXes
- Flash loan execution for zero-capital arbitrage
- Risk management with minimum profit thresholds
- Multi-DEX support (Uniswap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, etc.)

### 2. Yield Farming
- Automated yield farming across multiple protocols
- Dynamic reallocation based on APY
- Risk-adjusted returns optimization
- Supported protocols: Aave, Compound, Curve

### 3. MEV Extraction
- Sandwich attack opportunities
- Frontrunning protection
- Mempool monitoring
- Gas optimization for MEV extraction

### 4. Virtual Card System
- Automated virtual card issuance via Stripe
- Transaction monitoring and limits
- Instant profit distribution
- Integrated wallet management

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Stripe account with API keys
- Node.js 14+ (for Web3 integration)
- Termux (for Android deployment)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blackbox-swarm-prime.git
cd blackbox-swarm-prime
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Stripe API keys
```

4. Start the system:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/start.sh
./scripts/start.sh
```

## Wallet and Funds Management

The system manages user funds using the WalletManager class, which persists wallet data to a file named `wallets.json` in the working directory.

### Persisting Wallet Data

- Wallet data is automatically saved to `wallets.json` after any update.
- On system startup, wallet data is loaded from `wallets.json` to restore balances.

### Checking Wallet Balances

You can check wallet balances using the CLI script:

```bash
python3 scripts/show_balance.py <user_id>
```

Replace `<user_id>` with the user identifier.

### Ensuring Data Persistence While Running

To ensure wallet data is saved regularly while the system is running, run the periodic save script in parallel:

```bash
bash scripts/save_wallets_periodically.sh &
```

This script saves wallet data every 5 minutes.

### Termux Setup Script

For Termux users, a setup script `termux_setup.sh` is provided to automate pulling the latest code and creating necessary scripts.

Run it with:

```bash
bash termux_setup.sh
```

## API Endpoints

### Stripe Integration
